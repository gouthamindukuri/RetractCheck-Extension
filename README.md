# RetractCheck

RetractCheck is a browser extension that checks research articles against the [Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/) database. It works on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

When you visit a research article, the extension extracts the DOI from the page and checks if there are any retraction notices, corrections, or expressions of concern associated with it. If something is found, you'll see it in the popup along with links to the relevant notices.

This project is unofficial and not affiliated with Retraction Watch. All credit for maintaining the retraction records goes to the Retraction Watch team — they do the hard work of tracking these notices so researchers don't have to.

The supported site list (~500 academic publishers and repositories) comes from the [PubPeer browser extension](https://github.com/PubPeerFoundation/PubPeerBrowserExtensions) project. If a site you use isn't supported, click "Check anyway" in the popup or open an issue to request it.

Contributions are welcome. See the [getting started guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for setup instructions.
